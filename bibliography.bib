	abstract = {Fano resonance is observed in a wide range of micro- and nano-optical systems and has been a subject of intensive investigations due to its numerous potential applications. Methods that can control or modulate Fano resonance by tuning some experimentally accessible parameters are highly desirable for realistic applications. Here we present a simple yet elegant approach using the Mueller matrix formalism for controlling the Fano interference eﬀect and engineering the resulting asymmetric spectral line shape in an anisotropic optical system. The approach is founded on a generalized model of anisotropic Fano resonance, which relates the spectral asymmetry to physically meaningful and experimentally accessible parameters of interference, namely, the Fano phase shift and the relative amplitudes of the interfering modes. The diﬀerences in these parameters between orthogonal linear polarizations in an anisotropic system are exploited to desirably tune the Fano spectral asymmetry using pre- and postselection of optimized polarization states. The concept is demonstrated on waveguided plasmonic crystals using Mueller matrix-based polarization analysis. The approach enabled tailoring of several exotic regimes of Fano resonance in a single device, including the complete reversal of the spectral asymmetry, and shows potential for applications involving control and manipulation of electromagnetic waves at the nanoscale.},

	abstract = {This paper starts with a brief review of the topic of strong and weak pre- and post-selected ({PPS}) quantum measurements, as well as weak values, and afterwards presents original work. In particular, we develop a nonperturbative theory of weak {PPS} measurements of an arbitrary system with an arbitrary meter, for arbitrary initial states of the system and the meter. New and simple analytical formulas are obtained for the average and the distribution of the meter pointer variable. These formulas hold to all orders in the weak value. In the case of a mixed preselected state, in addition to the standard weak value, an associated weak value is required to describe weak {PPS} measurements. In the linear regime, the theory provides the generalized Aharonov–Albert–Vaidman formula. Moreover, we reveal two new regimes of weak {PPS} measurements: the strongly-nonlinear regime and the inverted region (the regime with a very large weak value), where the system-dependent contribution to the pointer deflection decreases with increasing the measurement strength. The optimal conditions for weak {PPS} measurements are obtained in the strongly-nonlinear regime, where the magnitude of the average pointer deflection is equal or close to the maximum. This maximum is independent of the measurement strength, being typically of the order of the pointer uncertainty. In the optimal regime, the small parameter of the theory is comparable to the overlap of the pre- and post-selected states. We show that the amplification coefficient in the weak {PPS} measurements is generally a product of two qualitatively different factors. The effects of the free system and meter Hamiltonians are discussed. We also estimate the size of the ensemble required for a measurement and identify optimal and efficient meters for weak measurements. Exact solutions are obtained for a certain class of the measured observables. These solutions are used for numerical calculations, the results of which agree with the theory. Moreover, the theory is extended to allow for a completely general post-selection measurement. We also discuss timesymmetry properties of {PPS} measurements of any strength and the relation between {PPS} and standard (not post-selected) measurements.},

	abstract = {Coherence of electronic states is crucial for quantum manipulation through light{\textendash}matter interactions. To achieve coherence in conventional solid-state systems, extreme conditions such as cryogenic temperatures are required, which is a long-term challenge for practical applications. The emerging atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides provide an unprecedented platform to explore the interplay of quantum states of spin and valley. In this paper, we demonstrate room-temperature valley coherence and valley polarization in bilayer WS2 with polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements. The robustness of the valley coherence and valley polarization is understood as the consequence of the coupling of spin, layer, and valley degrees of freedom in bilayer WS2. It inspires new perspectives on quantum manipulations in 2D solid-state systems.We report the observation of anomalously robust valley polarization and valley coherence in bilayer WS2. The polarization of the photoluminescence from bilayer WS2 follows that of the excitation source with both circular and linear polarization, and remains even at room temperature. The near-unity circular polarization of the luminescence reveals the coupling of spin, layer, and valley degree of freedom in bilayer system, and the linearly polarized photoluminescence manifests quantum coherence between the two inequivalent band extrema in momentum space, namely, the valley quantum coherence in atomically thin bilayer WS2. This observation provides insight into quantum manipulation in atomically thin semiconductors.},
